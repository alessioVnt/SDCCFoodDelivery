# "gcb" profile allows building and pushing the images
# on Google Container Builder without requiring docker
# installed on the developer machine. However, note that
# since GCB does not cache the builds, each build will
# start from scratch and therefore take a long time.
#
# This is not used by default. To use it, run:
#     skaffold run -p gcb
